## GLM

Finish writing the formal definition as well as understanding IRLS. Right now I've watched the video but didn't get it
will be doing that in the future since the main ideas I understood.

Still don't know how do we need booth the link function and distribuitin when generating a h function.
I know what both are, but don't understand why one isn't sufficient.
